### Miscellaneous small practices

#### Practice 1 ISO-8601

*Given an ISO-8601 date/time string as input, ouput the year/month/day/hour/minute/second/timezone parts of the corresponding time.*

#### Practice 2 Count the Characters

*Given a string, count the occurrences of each of every characters within it and output the result sorted.*

#### Practice 3 Super Prime

*Given 2011 is a prime number that can be presented as sum of 11 consecutive primes [157,163,167,173,179,181,191,193,197,199,211], find the immediate next prime with the same characteristics.*
